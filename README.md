Building upon the foundation of the existing Research Infrastructure for Big Data and Social Mining (SoBigData) platform, our system aims to further exploit social and geographical datasets through advanced algorithms. The primary focus is on providing optimized transportation routes, enhancing ur- ban mobility solutions with greater efficiency and sustainability. By working together with SoBigData, our system will use its powerful data processing abilities to improve what we offer, adding our own algorithms for digging into data and analyzing it. This collaboration is expected to make a big difference in how we understand peopleâ€™s movement patterns and improve traffic control and urban planning.
